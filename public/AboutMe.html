<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I’m someone who’s full of feminine energy—energetic, lovely, and passionate about the 
things I love. My world is a mix of creativity and connection. I spend a lot of time 
reading, watching movies, cooking, and designing because these activities let me explore 
new ideas and express myself. Right now, I’m really focused on learning Web Development 
and finishing college, channeling all my energy into achieving these goals.</p>

<p>Art, music, and literature are close to my heart. They inspire me and keep my creative 
spirit alive. When I need to unwind, I love getting lost in a good book, going for walks, 
or relaxing with a movie. But above all, spending time with my boyfriend and family is 
what I treasure most. They’re my support system and my source of happiness. And while I 
don’t have any pets, if I had to pick, I’d definitely choose dogs.</p>

<p>In short, I’m someone who’s driven and passionate but also finds joy in the simple, meaningful moments of life.</p>
